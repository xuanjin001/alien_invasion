Alien Invasion Game

In the game _Alien Invasion_, the player controls a spaceship that initially appears at the center bottom of the screen. The player can move the spaceship left and right using the arrow keys and shoot using the spacebar. At the start of the game, a group of aliens appears in the sky and moves downward across the screen. The player's objective is to shoot and eliminate these aliens. Once all the aliens are destroyed, a new group of aliens appears, moving at a faster speed. If any alien collides with the player's spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses one spaceship. The game ends when the player loses three spaceships.
